### Greetings ðŸ‘‹

My name is S.S. Nishchay. I develop software and teach new engineers how to do the same.

I live in Pune, India. I currently work for Hexagon, India.

I have been building system software, computational and embedded software for the last ten years, both as an employee in various firms as well as an independent consultant.
I have also taught computer science and engineering courses and faculty development programs in various institutes.

On this page you can find some of my publicly available work. Some of my more advanced work is still under non-disclosure agreements, so I cannot upload that code here.

You can find my full resume [here](https://github.com/falconer24/falconer24/blob/1d553dae90c2779b35598f83a9e25283d98eadb4/cv_nishchay_mhatre_dec_2021.pdf)

You can reach me at *nishchay.office@gmail.com*.
